# ðŸ”¬ Data Science Snippets & Hints

Welcome to my **Data Science Snippets** repository â€” a personal collection of reusable code patterns, mini-notebooks, and practical tips that I've found valuable in day-to-day data work.

Whether it's a quick pandas trick, a common `sklearn` pattern, or a debugging tip for models in production, this repo acts as a **living cheatsheet** for rapid experimentation and efficient coding.
